This is a fork of Sauvignon that makes it compatible with 1.4 without the bugs in other unofficial patches.

**Sauvignon in Stardew** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod which lets you build
a beautiful winery via Robin. Takes 4 days to construct. Once built, all kegs and casks work 30%
faster inside the building and show time remaining on mouse over.

## Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
2. Install [this mod from Nexus mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2597).
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Use
You can build the Winery building through Robin's carpentry menu. It costs 40 000 Gold, 200
Hardwood, 100 Clay, and 100 Stone, and takes four days to construct. The building is 11 tiles wide
by 6 tiles deep. The building textures are automatically seasonal, and features a walk-through
archway.

Inside the winery, a lovely music track plays. Casks can be used inside the building. Casks and
kegs inside the building work 30% faster, and show a tooltip with the product and time remaining
when you point at them.

At level 10 farming, you can choose a new Distiller profession in the tiller branch. This adds a
40% sell bonus to all alcohol (including wines, beers, meads, and IPAs), which are part of a new
Distilled Craft category. The Artisan profession no longer affects alcohols.

## Configure
The mod creates a `config.json` file in its mod folder the first time you run it. You can open that
file in a text editor to configure the mod.

These are the available settings:

| setting                   | what it affects
| ------------------------- | -------------------
| `DistillerProfessionBool` | Default `true`. Whether to add the new Distiller profession. (Disabling this will return the Artisan profession to normal.)

## Compatibility
Sauvignon is compatible with Stardew Valley 1.3+ on Linux/Mac/Windows. Not tested in multiplayer.
